# Contributing to JELOS
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.  Contributors are able to 

- Report a bug
- Discuss the current state of the code
- Submit a fix
- Propose new features
- Become a maintainer

## Becoming a maintainer
When contributing to JELOS you are expected to become the maintainer of your contribution.  Please keep this in mind when submitting pull requests.
* Keep track of your contributions upstreams and keep your components up-to-date.
* Watch the issue tracker and resolve issues related to your contribution.

## We Develop with Github
We use Gith to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure your code is built locally and tested.
3. Any changes should be reflected in the documentation.
6. Issue a pull request.

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be contributed under the same license as the original project code or under [Apache 2](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) license when no other license applies.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/jelos/distribution/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Follow the same style as the source you are editing.
* If you are contributing new code, keep the style consistent with other similar works.
* Parameterize as much as possible, try to avoid hard coded values whenever you can.
* Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs when possible.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the license of the existing project code being modified or Apache 2.
